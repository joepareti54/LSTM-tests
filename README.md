Demand Prediction with LSTMs using TensorFlow 2 and Keras in Python

the purpose of this exercise is not to create a valid dataset for
LSTM training, but to follow through the matrix transformations that need to be done,
especially to visualize that X_train is a 3d tensor where:
the 1st dimension is the batch
the 2nd dimension is the number of time steps
the 3rd dimension is the number of features
